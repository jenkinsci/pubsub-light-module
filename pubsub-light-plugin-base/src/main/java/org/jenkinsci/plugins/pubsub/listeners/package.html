Jenkins Listener implementations.
<p/>
The Jenkins core "listener" model is typically synchronous in nature i.e. they look for
{@code ExtensionPoint} implementations and call them synchronously from one {@link Thread}. This model obviously
does not scale.
<p/>
The listener implementations in this package convert these heavy-weight synchronous events into light-weight asynchronous events,
making it possible to distribute to a large number of subscribers (see <a href="../ChannelSubscriber.html">ChannelSubscriber</a>).
